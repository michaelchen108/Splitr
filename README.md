This application was developed by Michael Chen (myself), Archit Dua, Seunghun Oh, and Douglas Chen. This application uses Tesseract, an open source OCR library, to read images of receipts and parses the bought items on the receipt. Users are then allowed to assign items to different people and calculate the subtotals that individuals owe for a meal or a group trip to the grocery store.
